## About

VimWits, stands for Vim Where Is This Symbol. It helps get your wits about the code.

This plugin is used to automatically underline all visible occurrences of the symbol currently under the cursor. Unlike other attempts to do this, it works in real time and should not slow down navigating or editing. It is similar to the |matchparen| plugin in usage and implementation.

To use, simply install and edit your code files. When your cursor is above a non-highlighted symbol, it will get underlined, along with all other occurrences of the symbol on screen.
